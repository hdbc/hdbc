HDBC
====

Welcome to HDBC, Haskell Database Connectivity.

HDBC is modeled loosely on Perl's DBI interface, though it has also
been influenced by Python's DB-API v2, JDBC in Java, and HSQL in
Haskell.

Please see the HDBC [wiki](https://github.com/hdbc/hdbc/wiki) for an
introduction to HDBC and its various features.
