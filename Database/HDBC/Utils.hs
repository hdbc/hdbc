{- | Execute some code.  If any uncaught exception occurs, run
'rollback' and re-raise it.  Otherwise, run 'commit' and return.

This function, therefore, encapsulates the logical property that a transaction
is all about: all or nothing.

The 'IConnection' object passed in is passed directly to the specified
function as a convenience.

This function traps /all/ uncaught exceptions, not just SqlErrors.  Therefore,
you will get a rollback for any exception that you don't handle.  That's
probably what you want anyway.

Since all operations in HDBC are done in a transaction, this function doesn't
issue an explicit \"begin\" to the server.  You should ideally have
called 'Database.HDBC.commit' or 'Database.HDBC.rollback' before
calling this function.  If you haven't, this function will commit or rollback
more than just the changes made in the included action.

If there was an error while running 'rollback', this error will not be
reported since the original exception will be propogated back.  (You'd probably
like to know about the root cause for all of this anyway.)  Feedback
on this behavior is solicited.

{- | Lazily fetch all rows from an executed 'Statement'.

You can think of this as hGetContents applied to a database result set.

The result of this is a lazy list, and each new row will be read, lazily, from
the database as the list is processed.

When you have exhausted the list, the 'Statement' will be 'finish'ed.

Please note that the careless use of this function can lead to some unpleasant
behavior.  In particular, if you have not consumed the entire list, then
attempt to 'finish' or re-execute the statement, and then attempt to consume
more elements from the list, the result will almost certainly not be what
you want.

But then, similar caveats apply with hGetContents.

Bottom line: this is a very convenient abstraction; use it wisely.

Use 'fetchAllRows'' if you need something that is strict, without
all these caveats.
