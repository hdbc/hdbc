{- | Execute some code.  If any uncaught exception occurs, run
'rollback' and re-raise it.  Otherwise, run 'commit' and return.

This function, therefore, encapsulates the logical property that a transaction
is all about: all or nothing.

The 'IConnection' object passed in is passed directly to the specified
function as a convenience.

This function traps /all/ uncaught exceptions, not just SqlErrors.  Therefore,
you will get a rollback for any exception that you don't handle.  That's
probably what you want anyway.

Since all operations in HDBC are done in a transaction, this function doesn't
issue an explicit \"begin\" to the server.  You should ideally have
called 'Database.HDBC.commit' or 'Database.HDBC.rollback' before
calling this function.  If you haven't, this function will commit or rollback
more than just the changes made in the included action.

If there was an error while running 'rollback', this error will not be
reported since the original exception will be propogated back.  (You'd probably
like to know about the root cause for all of this anyway.)  Feedback
on this behavior is solicited.
